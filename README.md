# AutomateGmail-using-gmail-api
Problem statement:-
  Get the emails in INBOX filtered based on the 'Date' and the 'Subject'  entered.
  
Traditional approach:-
  We search the mails in the search bar of the gmail, but we can  search only one at a time.
  imap and pop3 are also the ways to achieve this goal.
  
Solution:-
  In imap and pop3 we have to expose our credentials which breaches security.
  The developed solution uses gmail-api which gets authorized by using the client-id and client-secretkey provided for the particular
  account which enhances secure authorization.
  
Technology stack:-
  Python3.x
 
How to run:-
1. get the Google api credentials:-
	** https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python
		-> enable the gmail api and download the credentials.json file.
		-> store it in the working directory of the project.
2. install 'pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib'
3. run quickstart.py to get authentication to gmail account given in the above link
	-> generates a .pickle file so that subsequent executions doesnt ask for authorization again
4. install the below modules
      i)pip3 install --upgrade oauth2client
      ii)pip3 install BeautifulSoup4
      iii)pip3 install python-dateutil
5. run the gmail_read.py file and authorize again.
6. enter the Date and the subjects you want to search and get the result.
7. the result will be the required search pattern you are searching for.
